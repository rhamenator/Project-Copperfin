# Windows VSIX Lifecycle Traceability Report

## Scope And Assurance Boundary

This report covers `RQ-CF-REL-003`: direct Windows VSIX installation,
identity/version, package-load/command, uninstall, and residue evidence. It
uses Copperfin's DO-178C-inspired general-purpose quality baseline; it is not a
claim of DO-178C compliance, certification, an assigned software level, or
suitability for a safety-critical deployment.

## Requirement And Verification Map

| Requirement | Verification | Controlled hazards |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RQ-CF-REL-003`; `DQ-windows-vsix-lifecycle-scope` — lifecycle evidence must be direct, bounded, exact-artifact-bound, instance-scoped, and must not infer unexecuted maintenance operations | `DV-windows-vsix-lifecycle-contract`; helper and assembler self-tests; exact-head hosted Windows execution required | `HZ-system-failure-01`; `HZ-data-corruption-01`; `HZ-doc-command-01` |

Reverse traceability is carried by `.github/workflows/build-vsix.yml`,
`scripts/test-windows-vsix-lifecycle.ps1`, `scripts/assemble-rc-candidate.py`,
the schema-v3 contract, durable matrix row, RC guide, and focused contract.

## Hazard, Misuse, Boundary, And Rollback Analysis

- A VSIX that compiles can still be rejected by VSIXInstaller, target the wrong
  Visual Studio instance, register but fail to load, or leave an extension
  behind after uninstall.
- The workflow runs on a disposable hosted Windows VM and selects exactly one
  instance containing the required Core Editor component. Install and uninstall
  receive that instance ID and the exact `Copperfin.VisualStudio` identity;
  both operations use VSIXInstaller's quiet mode without restart/elevation
  behavior being inferred.
  Profile inventory derives the registry/profile major from the selected
  installation version rather than assuming one Visual Studio release.
- The precondition rejects an already installed Copperfin extension. The
  verifier inventories only that selected instance and never deletes extension
  directories to manufacture a clean result.
- Lifecycle execution immediately follows package construction, before managed
  test programs run, so a test descendant cannot become a VSIXInstaller
  blocking process. MSBuild node reuse is disabled so the package-construction
  process does not remain as an installer blocker. Later managed tests consume
  the same built package only after uninstall and residue verification succeed.
- The PRG fixture, activity log, and extracted package live under one explicit
  runner-temporary evidence root. Visual Studio launches with that directory as
  its working directory, so the smoke does not rely on the source checkout.
- VSIXInstaller has a bounded wait and timed-out process-tree termination.
  Visual Studio has a bounded observation window, then receives a normal close
  request before bounded tree termination fallback.
- The activity log must identify the Copperfin assembly or package GUID after
  invoking the registered `Copperfin.ShowCommandWindow` command. Visual Studio
  first opens the runner-owned PRG and exposes a real main window; a second
  bounded `devenv` invocation then forwards the command to that running
  instance. A process that merely starts does not count as package-load
  evidence.
- Same-version reinstall, previous-version upgrade/coexistence, and disablement
  remain explicit `NOT_RUN` states. They cannot be promoted by this slice.

Potential severity is **high** because false VSIX lifecycle evidence could
admit a package that destabilizes a developer's IDE or cannot be removed. No
customer project, installed VFP9 asset, credential, or user-owned data is used.

Before an RC consumes this contract, rollback is a coordinated revert of the
workflow, helper, assembler/schema, and documentation. After consumption, do
not rewrite its tag or evidence: withdraw the candidate, publish the affected
VSIX digest and failed stage, correct the package or verifier with regression
coverage, and issue the next sequential immutable candidate.

## Verification And Residual Gaps

Local helper self-test, focused contract, RC assembler self-test, and schema
validation pass. Exact-head hosted Windows execution is pending. Therefore
`RQ-CF-REL-003` remains `gap`; this report does not claim direct lifecycle
success yet. VSIX signing, same-version reinstall, previous-version upgrade,
disablement, and human visual review remain separate.
