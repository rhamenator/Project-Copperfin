# Project Copperfin

Project Copperfin is a clean-room blueprint for a modern successor to Visual FoxPro-style business application development.

Current engineering priority:

- security and speed first
- language choice second

This folder captures the current plan for a new platform that can:

- preserve access to legacy xBase/FoxPro-era data and application assets
- work with modern relational databases such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle
- interoperate deeply with the .NET ecosystem and produce .NET-consumable outputs
- provide a modern runtime, designer, reporting stack, and migration path
- add modern security, packaging, deployment, and observability
- avoid direct reuse of FoxPro/VFP branding

Why "Copperfin"?

- `Copper` signals durable infrastructure, wiring, and business systems.
- `Fin` signals navigation, movement, and forward compatibility.
- It does not reuse the Fox/FoxPro/VFP brand family.

Important note:

- `Copperfin` is a working codename and branding starter, not a legal clearance opinion.
- A formal trademark review should happen before public release, filing, or product launch.

Recommended next build order:

1. File engine for DBF/FPT/CDX/DBC fidelity.
2. Connector layer for SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.
3. Query/runtime core with compatibility tests.
4. Forms and reports import/render pipeline.
5. Migration toolkit and packaging.
6. Security and policy layer.

Implementation bias:

- native core for performance-sensitive and trust-sensitive subsystems
- optional higher-level companion tooling only when it stays outside the product core
- first-class .NET interoperability and 64-bit support
- selective Rust use is acceptable where it materially improves safety or speed
- first-class ability to open, inspect, edit, and eventually execute legacy VFP assets

Current runnable artifacts:

- `build\Release\copperfin_inspect.exe`
  - low-level file and index inspection for DBF/VFP asset families
- `build\Release\copperfin_studio_host.exe`
  - early human-facing Studio host for opening legacy VFP assets and previewing schema/records
  - now supports `--json` snapshots for Visual Studio designer integration
  - now supports `--list-subsystems` to inspect the planned VFP 9-equivalent Copperfin subsystem map
  - now emits a structured `reportLayout` snapshot for `FRX/FRT` and `LBX/LBT` assets with named sections and placed objects
- `build\Release\copperfin_build_host.exe`
  - native package/build pipeline entry point for `PJX/PJT` projects
  - stages project assets, emits runtime and debug manifests, bundles the runtime host, and can publish a generated `.NET` launcher
- `build\Release\copperfin_runtime_host.exe`
  - native runtime/debug launch host for packaged Copperfin applications
  - reads `app.cfmanifest` and now executes `PRG` startup code through a native xBase runtime session
  - supports real breakpoint and step-debugging actions for `PRG` startup paths
  - now emits richer debug state including call stack, locals, globals, and runtime events for debugger surfaces in Visual Studio and standalone Studio
  - now bootstraps runnable `SCX/VCX/MNX` startup behavior through generated `PRG` wrappers
  - now boots runnable `FRX/LBX` startup assets into direct preview/event-loop mode instead of treating them as inert metadata
  - packaged `SCX/VCX` startup assets now stage their memo sidecars and can launch from packaged content instead of only from source trees
  - now recognizes `ACTIVATE MENU` / `ACTIVATE POPUP` as real event-loop runtime operations
  - now supports dispatching runtime actions back into waiting xAssets through `--debug-command select:<action-id>` and `--debug-command invoke:<action-id>`
  - menu startup assets can now dispatch real menu-item selections while paused in the event loop
  - runtime xAsset execution now loads the full backing table instead of only the small Studio preview slice, so deeper menu trees and later records can participate in execution
  - form/class/report/label method surfaces now expose dispatchable runtime actions derived from extracted xBase methods
  - `DO FORM` now resolves quoted paths cleanly and launches runnable forms into the event loop instead of treating them like one-shot helper scripts
  - still reports compatibility-mode launch information for non-runnable xAssets and other startup assets while those runtimes are under construction
- `vsix\Copperfin.VisualStudio\Copperfin.VisualStudio.csproj`
  - installable Visual Studio extension baseline for VS 2022+
  - current output: `vsix\Copperfin.VisualStudio\bin\Release\net472\Copperfin.VisualStudio.vsix`
  - registers a first `Copperfin Visual Designer` document shell for `PJX/SCX/VCX/FRX/LBX/MNX`
  - current shell shows object/property snapshots sourced from the native Studio host
  - current `SCX/SCT` and `VCX/VCT` slices expose flattened VFP `PROPERTIES` data for inline object selection, design-surface layout, drag-move, and safe property edits
  - current `FRX/FRT` and `LBX/LBT` slices now surface named report sections in a more modern Visual Studio-style designer shell, with section-aware layout editing for `HPOS/VPOS/WIDTH/HEIGHT` plus key expression/font fields
  - current `MNX/MNT` slices support asset-aware property-grid editing for menu metadata
  - current `PJX/PJT` slices now surface a grouped project workspace with project-item grouping, startup/build-plan summary, and project-entry property editing
  - project workspaces now also surface the platform's native security/RBAC posture and `.NET`/Python/MCP extensibility story
  - project workspaces now include a first integrated debugger pane backed by the native runtime host, with pause reason, call stack, locals, globals, and runtime-event summaries
- `vsix\Copperfin.Studio\Copperfin.Studio.csproj`
  - standalone Windows shell that reuses the same shared report/label/form/menu/project designer controls outside Visual Studio
  - now opens multiple assets as tabs so the managed shell feels more like an IDE workspace instead of a single-document dialog
  - now shares the same first integrated project debugger pane used by the Visual Studio designer shell
  - current output: `vsix\Copperfin.Studio\bin\Release\net472\Copperfin.Studio.exe`
- `vsix\Copperfin.DesignerSmokeTests\Copperfin.DesignerSmokeTests.csproj`
  - automated WinForms smoke tests for the shared designer UI
  - current output: `vsix\Copperfin.DesignerSmokeTests\bin\Release\net472\Copperfin.DesignerSmokeTests.exe`
  - exercises synthetic rendering plus real `invoice.frx`, `cust.lbx`, and `solution.pjx` assets from the local VFP 9 sample tree
  - now smoke-tests the shared project debugger surface against a real VFP sample project

E:\Project-Copperfin\build\Release\copperfin_studio_host.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual FoxPro 9\Samples\Solution\solution.pjx"

E:\Project-Copperfin\build\Release\copperfin_build_host.exe build --project "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual FoxPro 9\Samples\Solution\solution.pjx" --output-dir "E:\Project-Copperfin\artifacts\runtime-smoke" --configuration debug --enable-security --emit-dotnet-launcher

```

Current MVP scope:

- open `PJX/PJT`, `SCX/SCT`, `VCX/VCT`, `FRX/FRT`, `LBX/LBT`, `MNX/MNT`, `DBF/FPT`, `CDX/DCX`, `IDX`, `NDX`, and `MDX`
- inspect headers and companion files
- preview DBF-style schema and a small number of records
- decode memo-backed preview values for synthetic and many real sidecar-backed assets

Known limitation:

- memo-heavy real-world designer files still need deeper VFP-specific decoding and presentation polish before they feel like a true visual designer
- the Visual Studio extension and standalone Studio now provide a shared project debugger pane on top of the native runtime/debug host, but they still do not provide full VFP 9-style design fidelity or the full FoxPro/VFP runtime surface
- packaged runtime output is now good enough to launch runnable `SCX/VCX/MNX` startup assets from staged package content, but broader asset-family execution and deeper event/lifecycle fidelity still need work
- packaged runtime output is now good enough to launch runnable `SCX/VCX/MNX/FRX/LBX` startup assets from staged package content, but deeper event/lifecycle fidelity still needs work
- runtime action dispatch now covers menu selection and extracted method invocation, but higher-fidelity form/report object lifecycle, richer UI event simulation, and broader runtime semantics still need work
- runtime execution no longer truncates to the Studio preview record limit, which improves parity for deeper `MNX` submenu trees and other larger xAssets
- the new standalone Studio shell shares the same editor stack, but it is still an early shell rather than the finished full-fidelity Copperfin IDE
- the standalone Studio shell now supports tabbed multi-document editing, but it still needs richer IDE chrome and workflow parity before it feels like the full VFP 9 experience
