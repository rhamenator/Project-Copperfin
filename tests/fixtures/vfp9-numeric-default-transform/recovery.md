# Default Numeric TRANSFORM recovery — #5611/#6776/#7189, tracking #7210

## Pre-observation contract

`RQ-CF-PRG-NUMERIC-DEFAULT-TRANSFORM-001` derives from owner Numeric
compatibility policy and parent `RQ-CF-PRG-NUMERIC-METADATA-001`.
Recover the default Numeric-to-Character display consumer's use of associated
width/decimal metadata and SET DECIMALS/FIXED. Allowed requirement sources are
installed VFP9 public behavior and owner policy, not the existing formatter.
The #6776 per-area compatibility-switch policy, checked conversions and
allocation limits remain unchanged. Neither Numeric metadata fields alone nor
an approximate/tolerance result establish display parity.

Unchanged main240ac51cb and the deferred small-divisor branch already reproduce
70 literal-only display mismatches while all300 literal metadata/payloads match:
signed checkpoint03c3a4520446765125101be7052a05bf7e6f0546 and issue
comment6249598072. At D0/FIXED OFF, current0.5 prints `0`, native `0.5`;
current2.50 prints `2`, native `2.50`, both NUMERICBEHAVIOR modes. This is
reproduction, not a proven algorithm or product acceptance.

## Frozen native stimulus (not expected results)

`emit-probe.cjs` produces the checked-in `probe.prg` and `cases.json`
without importing Copperfin, candidate logic or expected data. It declares
58 literal forms and24 group/unary/IIF controls, DECIMALS0/1/2/6/14/18,
FIXED OFF/ON, and four distinct routes: direct EVALUATE, direct compiled,
EVALUATE then local assignment, compiled then local assignment.3936 records
per invocation. All expressions are pure; repeated evaluations for metadata,
BRS and default TRANSFORM cannot repeat a user callback.

Each observation retains public-ABI CFNMETA type/width/decimals/active payload
and FPU control word, independent BRS payload, exact Character bytes and
VARTYPE. Reuse the already-authored documented public-ABI observer
`build/pr7203-completed/native-evidence/diagnostic/cause-probe.fll` on the host.
No binary decompilation, disassembly, patching, proprietary implementation
reuse, new installation or VM is involved. The installed VFP9 Wine executable,
observer and runner must be hash-bound before/after execution.

`audit-probe.cjs` is an independent strict raw reader. It requires both actual
statuses0, empty stderr, complete unique inventory coverage, finite typed
payload/BRS agreement, Character output, equivalent compiled/EVALUATE routes
and exact typed repeat. Inactive ABI slots are not semantic equality.
No expectation emitter, candidate, test or production code exists yet.

## Qualification and bounds

Freeze source/inventory/reader in a signed DCO commit BEFORE invocation.
Obtain fresh audit/DAW chat clearance and require full I/O PSI avg10 AND avg60
below1% immediately before EACH serialized nice10 invocation. Preserve all
failed/guarded attempts. Record REA Evidence, actual statuses, raw files,
hashes, pressure, root exit versus descendant settlement, cleanup, truncation
and limitations. The runner's25-second bound and inherited environment remain
explicit; process sampling is not syscall coverage or network containment.

Once qualified, native observations may define independent regression
expectations, then actual unchanged ORIGINAL failure before an unused bounded
support helper/direct tests, then separate consumer wiring and unchanged SAME.
Inspect architecture only as architecture, never as the requirement source.
Keep TRANSFORM pictures, Currency, locale changes, general display dispatch,
nonfinite policy, other Numeric producers and the deferred division helper out
of this slice unless additional native evidence explicitly makes one a required
prerequisite. Stored routes materialize at CURRENT settings; they do not prove
behavior of a variable assigned under another setting. That boundary remains
unknown pending a separately frozen probe if needed.

## First qualified native pair

Signed/DCO source freeze7a45097eb872d64f2e37357dee1b804fa33a358d precedes
both actual invocations. Fresh audit/DAW clearance obtained. Both native
statuses0/empty stderr; all3936 typed records and exact Character bytes repeat,
equivalent compiled/EVALUATE routes agree. Source/runner/VFP9/FLL before/after
hash checks0. Full PSI before first0.00%/0.03%, before repeat0.00%/0.02%.
Both chats received RELEASED; prefix process postcheck empty/exit1.

First raw SHA2569908c60cbc39b1585b463182550e07fae68868ce8de8f21a98c75d00e4fde4d9;
repeat7e2d5030fdea536a4ee9cdce292adbc8aa2000989e15184c20da0faca327d14a.
They are NOT raw-byte identical: one unused real slot of type-I differs.
Initial reader0/report/source are preserved. Strengthened reader explicitly
checks every raw difference is confined to inactive ABI slots, returns0, and
the archived readback report compares byte-identical to the host report.
No native rerun or expected-result change for this strengthening.

REA ev_b5c385b50babd0d46ce575ce70612afc29509d23ec249752ecddbb2eeef6fe67:
root exit0, descendants quiesced, owned process group cleanup verified,
temporary root removed, untruncated. Full structured record in captures/;
prelaunch executable binding is bash, not an atomic VFP9 image binding.
Native/runner/FLL hashes bind sampled files separately. Short-lived descendants
can escape sampling, snapshots are not syscall traces, inherited environment
is not recorded; no network-containment/security-sandbox claim.

Observed, not a general formula:

- FIXED OFF direct2.50 and its assigned copy both display2.50, but1.00
  displays1; settings0 through18 do not change those literal displays.
- FIXED ON changes0.5 to1 at D0,0.50 at D2, and18 fractional places at D18.
  This is half-tie evidence, not authority for all rounding boundaries.
- Direct1E-14 displays .00000000000001 (no leading zero), assigned copy
  displays0.00000000000001; payload/scale match but width differs15 versus25.
  At D0/FIXED ON that direct display is empty while assigned copy displays0.
- Negative nonzero tiny literal -0.000000000000000001 displays -0 with FIXED
  OFF, whereas true signed zero -0.00 displays0. At D0/FIXED ON both display0.
- The18-scale1.234567890123456789 displays1.234567890123457000; simply
  streaming18 exact binary64 fractional digits is not the native requirement.
- Grouping may change associated metadata (already a separate completed
  producer concern). No producer correction is admitted by this display probe.
- Large/exponent controls retain exponent/asterisk outputs, not a newly
  authorized conversion or overflow policy.

Unknowns before implementation: exact finite formatting/rounding boundary,
width/scale causality versus correlated literal syntax, FIXED width handling,
and display after settings change without re-assignment. NEXT separately
freeze controlled public-ABI metadata interventions plus cross-setting stored
values and rounding controls, recover those boundaries, then native-only
regression/actual ORIGINAL before support/wiring. No production change yet.

## Follow-up intervention attempt and narrower source freeze

Signed/DCO source f07ab8b0c9edfbfacf61d71248a3b316f519675a froze384 GRID
expressions and12 STORED expressions,2736 observations per run. Eight finite
real seeds have baseline and bit/field-preserving CFNCLONE controls plus42
width/scale interventions each (widths1/2/3/4/12/20/40,
scales0/1/2/14/15/18). CFNWIDTH/CFNDEC use the existing
authored public-ABI observer source in vfp9-listitem-column-numeric/cause-probe.c;
no new FLL, arithmetic or implementation logic. Read back requested metadata,
unchanged BRS payload and FPU word before accepting any causal observation.
The32 additional finite rounding controls discriminate binary precision/ties
and integer-digit magnitudes. GRID uses EVALUATE only: no compiled-equivalence
claim for this intervention grid.

Twelve private values are assigned explicit compiled expressions once under
each birth DECIMALS0/2/18 and FIXED OFF/ON. Subsequent nested display settings
read the SAME variables without reassignment; observer function references
private variables rather than passing them through a value parameter. It also
captures explicit STR(value,40,current DECIMALS) as diagnostic native bytes,
NOT as a model or requirement for TRANSFORM. Reader reports any metadata/payload
changes without assuming they are zero. Callback timing is not in this grid.

Actual attempt1, after fresh BOTH-chat clearance: first runner0/empty stderr
but ONLY387 observations/no DONE footer, so INCOMPLETE/UNQUALIFIED. Independent
frozen reader1 rejects the missing DONE|2736 footer. Last emitted observation:
D0/FIXED ON GRID3 CFNDEC(CFNWIDTH(0.50,1),0); next requested GRID4
CFNDEC(CFNWIDTH(0.50,1),1) was not emitted. No proven native crash, cause or
Copperfin defect is inferred from this abrupt ending. Initial release messages
reported runner0, then both chats received the explicit missing-footer
correction. No complete native-grid or test pass is claimed.

Full I/O PSI0.00%/0.00% before first invocation;19.34%/4.49% before repeat.
Pressure guard75 prevented second native invocation; no repeat status exists.
First source/VFP9/runner/FLL hashes unchanged. Raw first SHA256
b8b7abdaa151097a36af0559355757caca0e89db9a39843cf43513587690e0a0.
Lossless intervention-attempt1/ retains original source/inventory/reader, all
raw data, statuses, hash checks, guard, pressure, script and full REA record.
REA ev_c690dbad800eaa574d67879bffb95c1bbbc95a987a9491688466ae32eae0a944:
root75/quiesced/owned group verified/untruncated, BUT14 sampled processes have
EACCES environ ownership unknowns. Minimal readback retains root/system process
names/parents; it neither proves causation nor authorizes touching them. No
global cleanup claim. Same image-binding/sampling/environment limits as above.
Both chats RELEASED, prefix postcheck empty; no build/native/Wine/VM reserved.

Narrower current stimulus deliberately omits synthetic width<=scale pairs:
240 GRID +12 STORED expressions,1872 observations/run,24 interventions/seed.
This is an experimental safety restriction after the incomplete attempt, NOT
a recovered production validity rule or an explanation of the missing footer.
The natural width=scale+1 boundary (e.g.1E-14) remains covered. Original
f07ab8b0c source and partial capture remain immutable in Git and the archive.
Source/inventory/reader must be signed BEFORE renewed paired execution. Current
full PSI59.23%/43.38% disallows retry; no waiting resource window retained.
NEXT renewed BOTH-chat clearance plus low-pressure gates for this narrower
pair. Do not retrofit conclusions into the initial82-case stimulus or frozen
division tests. Production, expected emitter, model and helper remain absent.
The next source uses separate host directory build/default-transform-intervention2
so it cannot overwrite attempt1. Reader --single must validate completeness,
metadata interventions, payload/BRS and clone controls after FIRST capture
BEFORE allowing a second invocation. Its status0 means first-structure-only,
not repeat qualification or product parity. Preserve any first-structure failure
and stop; never treat runner0 alone as successful native completion.

## Traceability and development-document walkthrough

`VR-5611-NUMERIC-DEFAULT-TRANSFORM-001`: native qualification, native-only
expectation emitter, original-fail/SAME, focused/broader/actual named hosted
execution, exact-head review, strict checks and resolved conversations are
pending except the bounded first native pair qualified above. No compatibility,
parent, hazard or release closure.

`DQ-DV-5611-NUMERIC-DEFAULT-TRANSFORM-001`, LOW procedure delta: preserve the
uncancelled division source/test freeze3b7a51636 and complete ORIGINAL031d790ab;
work only in separate display WT from origin/main240ac. Walkthrough confirms
there is no formatter/hook change and no instruction to drop display assertions.
Misuse risk: mistaking a stimulus or fitted model for the oracle would permit
silent display/data corruption. Mitigation: immutable raw native paired capture,
independent expected reader, actual original fail, unchanged SAME and exact-head
review. HZ-data-corruption-01/HZ-runtime-crash-01/HZ-doc-command-01 unchanged.
Rollback is the exact display slice revert, retaining raw receipts; notify the
owner if evidence or shipped formatting is invalidated. Developer-maintainer
self-review only, not independent-human, system or release assurance.
